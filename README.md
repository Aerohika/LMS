# LMS
Learning Management System (LMS)
This project is a robust Learning Management System (LMS) designed as part of a university group assignment. The system leverages MongoDB to provide a highly functional and scalable platform, showcasing modern database techniques and cloud capabilities.

Features
The LMS integrates several advanced features to ensure efficiency, scalability, and security:

1. Database Schema Design
Structured schema tailored for LMS functionalities, ensuring data consistency and scalability.
2. CRUD Operations
Efficient Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing courses, students, assignments, and more.
3. Indexing and Aggregation
Optimized query performance using indexes.
Aggregation pipelines for insightful analytics and data processing.
4. Data Validation
Ensured data integrity through validation rules during schema definition.
5. Backup and Restore
Implemented reliable mechanisms for database backup and restoration to safeguard against data loss.
6. Sharding
Enabled horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple shards.
7. Real-Time Change Streams
Utilized MongoDB change streams to monitor real-time updates in key collections.
8. Text Search
Implemented full-text search capabilities for quick and accurate retrieval of information.
9. Security
Authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
